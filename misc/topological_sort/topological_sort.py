Topological Sort
Difficulty: Hard
Given a list of tasks and a list of dependencies return
a list of tasks in valid order. If no such order exists
return an empty array.

tasks = [1,2,3,4]
deps = [
    [2, 3],
    [2, 4],
    [4, 3],
    [1, 3],
    [1, 4],
]

topological_sort(tasks, deps) = [1,2,3,4] or [2,1,3,4]
