# Tail

Make a function that takes a sequence of items (`items`) (like a list, string, or tuple) and a number (`n`) and returns the last n elements from the given sequence, as a list.

For example:

```python
>>> tail([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
[3, 4, 5]
>>> tail('hello', 2)
['l', 'o']
>>> tail('hello', 0)
[]
```

Make sure that your function return an empty list for negative values of n:

```python
>>> tail('hello', -2)
[]
```

## Bonus

As a bonus, refactor your function to work with any iterable, not just sequences. For example:

```python
>>> squares = (n**2 for n in range(10))
>>> tail(squares, 3)
[49, 64, 81]
```

Some particulars about this new implementation:

- You should make sure you don't loop at all if n is 0 or negative.
- make your function relatively memory efficient (i.e. if you're looping over a very long iterable, don't store the entire thing in memory).

## Tests

Change directory in your terminal to the `Tail` directory and then run `python -m unittest` to run the tests for this challenge.

Feel free to reference the tests if you have any confusion about the expected behavior of the Circle class.

Good luck!
